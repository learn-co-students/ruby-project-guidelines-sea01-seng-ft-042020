## What is MovieBook?
MovieBook is a command line application that allows you (and those that share your computer) to write honest movie reviews. MovieBook allows users to share their reviews about a movie without feeling like they are being judged on their opinion or scolded for "giving away" the plotline. MovieBook uses the TMDb database to obtain movie information. This will give you access to a large selection of movies!
## Install MovieBook
To install MovieBook on to your local computer, please fork and clone this repository.
Got the repository? Awesome! Now, let's get your terminal working with the right `gems`. Run the command `bundle install` into your terminal. Great! You have all the `gems`, you're one step closer to getting started with MovieBook!
## TMDb API key
MovieBook uses the TMDb database to gather all the movies you would like to review. In order to use MovieBook, you must have a TMDb account and obtain an API key. 
**Instructions to obtain API key:**
1. To start, please create an account with TMDb [*here*](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
2. Go to your account settings
3. Select API on the lefthand sidebar
4. Select "click here" under Request an API key and follow the prompts to register
5. Once you are finished registering, go back to account settings
6. Select API on the lefthand sidebar
7. Find your API key "API Key (v3 auth)" and copy that key
Hooray, you got the key! Open up the MovieBook repository on your local computer and follow the instructions on how to enter your API key.
**Instructions to enter API key in MovieBook**
1. Open the `./app/adapter/tmdb.rb` file 
2. Find the `key` variable
3. Replace `ENV["TMDB_API_KEY"]` assigned to `key` with your copied API key
It should look like this:
```ruby
class Tmdb
    def self.get_data(keyword)
        key = ENV["TMDB_API_KEY"]   #<--- YOUR API KEY GOES HERE
        url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=#{key}&language=en-US&query=#{keyword}&page=1&include_adult=false"
        response = RestClient.get(url)
        response_body = response.body
        json_response = JSON.parse(response_body)
        movies = json_response["results"].map do |movie|
            {title: movie["title"]}
        end
    en
